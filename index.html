<br> Here's my Election Speech for EHP
<br> What this means for you as an EHP member is that you’ll have someone who has extensive connections in pretty much every area of Purdue that relates to cybersecurity. As member of the association of computing machinery, you can ask me about the latest developments in the new AI ethics scene.  
<br> As a member of CERIAS, you can ask me about research positions Purdue has if you want to get into an actual lab and start offensive security research while here.  
<br> As a participant for every other IT related club, you’ll have an officer that is connected and aware of whatever’s happening with all the other clubs in our same circle.  
<br> Say you want to know the reason why the Isilon server is down and now you’re not able to do your labs. You can now just straight up ask one of the sysadmins directly.  
<br> Want to know what happens when AMD and TSMC engineers beef with each other? Just ask me and I’ll tell you one of the many stories my classmates’ parents have when engineering companies try to work on projects together (as soon as the NDA expires). 
<br> Want to know what it’s like doing DevOps for Google overseas? I can hook you up to one of my good friends back home.  
<br> I also make sure to talk to CIT professors as much as I can in my free time, in this semester alone I’ve visited professors during office hours 13 times, half of them are actually with Professor Thomas, who is our club sponsor.  
<br> By making myself a more valuable and informed resource to everyone in EHP, I hope to contribute to EHP’s return back to our members.  
<br> One of the things that I hope to change at Ethical Hackers is to make us a club that is one of the most highly respected student organizations within Purdue. 
<br> Let’s take a look at Machine Learning @ Purdue for example. Most CS students who are taking the AI/ML track are probably aware of this club, which is so popular that they have to apply into just because of the sheer amount of applicants they get.  
<br> Their popularity is there for a reason though. My roommate, who is one of the most smurf AI undergrads ever recently just got himself a paid research position with funding and computing resources to start doing his own research using CUDA and ML. The club also generates a ton of attention and funding from Purdue and companies and are now one of the best funded clubs here.  
<br> While we are already a very impressive club to be a part of due to our size, topics, and events, and the open nature of the club itself. As a student leader, I hope to be working with your other officers to make sure that whenever another CS student finds out that you’re with the Ethical Hackers of Purdue, they’re going to immediately be impressed with the high standard of ethics and principles that you should hold yourself to just by being a member. If you’re like me and want to end up in the NSA or FBI with big ethic and moral responsiblities, I want to make EHP the most optimal club for people like us. 
<br> Say for example, you’re in a interview for an internship, and the recruiter asks you about this “ethical hackers of purdue” thing you were a part of. Once I get started with my plans, you should easily be able to proudly recall the code of ethical standard you held yourself to while studying redhatting and hacking here at Purdue.  
<br> How I am to do this is going to be pretty easy actually, I already have plans for events and meetings that will go over our current ethics contract as well as our ethical guidelines as a club. I’m going to scrub through each part of it to ensure that we are being cool members of society while also granting us freedom to experiment and learn our stuff. While leading the only CS-related club at my highschool of no CS classes at all, I also have under my belt years of technical experience and college-level ethics and psychologies studies that I’ve taken while at highschool. Using the times I’ve had to do pretty much the same exact things for my own club that I started back in highschool, I’ll make sure that we become the best and that EHP can be something you can proudly slap on your resume, regardless of your position.
